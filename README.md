  Blueprint to easily configure the **Tuya ERS-10TZBVK-AA Smart Knob** to control a media player when integrated into Home Assistant using **Zigbee2MQTT**.

    It is based directly on the MQTT-Topic as this turned out to be the most responsive way to automate this device.

    **Important Note:** The device needs to be in **COMMAND mode** for the automation to work. The blueprint will automatically check for the correct mode and should keep the device in COMMAND.

    Do a triple button press to change mode manually.
